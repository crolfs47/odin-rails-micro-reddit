# odin-rails-micro-reddit
## The Odin Project - Micro-Reddit

Create a simple version of Reddit using Rails. Build the data structures necessary to support 
link submissions and commenting. Don't build a front end for it, just use the Rails console to 
play around with the models.

## Languages/Technologies used:
 - Rails (models, migrating, validations, associations, testing in console)
 - Ruby
 - SQLite3
 - VS Code
 - Git/Github

## What I learned:
 - How to plan out a data model
 - Generating models, database migrations, validations and error messages, model associations
 - Testing in the rails console
 - How to create users, posts, and comments and manage the relationships between each model
 
## Still can improve:
 - This is an extremely simple application, hopefully will learn more about involving controllers, 
   views, etc in the next project
